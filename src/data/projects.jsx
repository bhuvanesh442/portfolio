          I built a full-stack Product Store using React, Express, Mongoose, and Zustand.  
          This project helped me learn how to structure folders efficiently, connect MongoDB Atlas using Mongoose, and establish seamless communication between the frontend and backend.  
          I also deployed the project on Render, gaining experience in full-stack deployment and state management with Zustand.

          I built a Twitter Clone using React, Express, Mongoose, JWT for authentication, and Zustand for state management.
          The UI is designed with Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI, providing a responsive and modern look. React Toast is used for 
          notifications, enhancing user experience. This project helped me learn how to implement authentication, structure
